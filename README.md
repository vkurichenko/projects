| 1 | Used boats advertisement model | Nearly New Nautical is a website that allows users to advertise their used boats for sale. To boost traffic to the website, the product manager wants to prevent listing boats that do not receive many views. <br /> The product manager wants to know if you can develop a model to predict the number of views a listing will receive based on the boat's features. She would consider using your model if, on average, the predictions were only 50% off of the true number of views a listing would receive. <br /> In addition, she has noticed that many users never complete the introductory survey to list their boat. She suspects that it is too long and has asked you whether some features are more predictive of views than others. If so, she may be able to trim the length of the survey and increase the number of people who sign up. |
| 2 | Used boats advertisement analysis | Nearly New Nautical is a website that allows users to advertise their used boats for sale. The marketing team is preparing a weekly newsletter for boat owners. The newsletter is designed to help sellers to get more views of their boat, as well as stay on top of market trends. The Head of Marketing has laid out an ambitious goal of increasing the number of readers by 75% this year. They would like you to take a look at the recent data and help them learn more about the characteristics of the most viewed boat listings in the last 7 days - is it the most expensive boats that get the most views? Are there common features among the most viewed boats? |
| 3 | Where should a drinks company run promotions? | Your company owns a chain of stores across Russia that sell a variety of alcoholic drinks. The company recently ran a wine promotion in Saint Petersburg that was very successful. Due to the cost to the business, it isn’t possible to run the promotion in all regions. The marketing team would like to target 10 other regions that have similar buying habits to Saint Petersburg where they would expect the promotion to be similarly successful. |
